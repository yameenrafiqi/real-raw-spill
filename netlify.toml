# Note: DO NOT store your MONGODB_URI here in the file
# Instead, set it in Netlify Dashboard:
# Site settings → Build & deploy → Environment → Environment variables
# Add: MONGODB_URI = your_mongodb_connection_string

# Also add ADMIN_PASSWORD in Netlify environment variables
# Add: ADMIN_PASSWORD = supersecret123 (or your chosen password)
